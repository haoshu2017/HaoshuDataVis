This is a Machine Learning project that used to predict the counts of bike sharing. 

By using ggplot2, I first investigated the relationships between the dependent variable (#bike sharing) and various potential predictors. 

Based on the graphs generated by ggplot2, I found that the frequency of bike sharing changes by season, workday, tempertature, holiday and time during the day.  
Hence, I then ran a linear regression model on the training data, using these predicting variables to predict the counts of bike sharing. 

Lastly, I applied the predictions on the testing data, the R2=0.76, suggeting that my training model explains away 76% of the variations in my testing data.
